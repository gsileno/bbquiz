Downloaded from http://blackboard.uva.nl/webapps/blackboard/execute/viewExtendedHelp?helpkey=question_upload&pluginId=_2123_1&ctx=course&course_id=_154585_1 on 1 April 2015.

Questions can be authored offline in a specially formatted text file and uploaded into Tests, Surveys, and Question Pools.
Once uploaded, questions can be edited and used like questions that have been authored in the system.

Batch File Guidelines

Follow these general guidelines for uploading files:
- Each file must be a tab-delimited .txt file.
- Do not include blank lines between records. The blank line will be processed and return an error.
- Blackboard recommends that each batch file not exceed 500 records because of time-out restrictions associated with most browsers.

File-Format Rules
Questions in the text file must conform to the following structure to be uploaded successfully:
- No header row for the file
- One question per row
- Duplicate questions are allowed
- Fields in a row are separated by a TAB
- Each field in the question correlates to the fields of the respective system-created question
- Point values for questions in an uploaded file cannot differ but can be edited after the upload
- The first field in every row defines the type of question
- Correct, Incorrect, True, False and other words that identify answers must be in English.

Note: Formatting errors in individual questions in a file will cause the questions to fail to upload, not the entire file.
